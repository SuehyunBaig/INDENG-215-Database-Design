## Business Description

The fictional business of our choice is a hybrid entertainment venue that operates as a concert hall, music school, and vinyl bar.

The core business centers on live performances. Artists are booked through vendors, and all artist-related payments are processed via corporate credit cards and recorded as transactions. 
Each performance generates ticket sales, which are purchased by customers. 

Customers are classified into two primary groups: concertgoers and students, with possible overlap between the two categories. 
This allows the business to support both entertainment and educational services.

Beyond live shows, the venue also runs a vinyl bar and music retail shop. 
Customers can enjoy listening the music in the bar, purchase albums and other merchandise associated with performing artists, creating an additional revenue stream and reinforcing the connection between live music and physical music products.
The business also offers music lessons, where students enroll in instructional sessions taught by instructors. Each lesson is tracked at the session level to manage enrollment and instruction.
